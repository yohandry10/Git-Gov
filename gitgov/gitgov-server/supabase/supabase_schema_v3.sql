-- GitGov Control Plane Schema v3 - Violation Decisions
-- =======================================================
-- MIGRATION: Run after supabase_schema_v2.sql
-- This adds: violation_decisions table, true append-only violations

-- ============================================================================
-- PART 1: CREATE VIOLATION_DECISIONS TABLE
-- ============================================================================
-- WHY: violations table was allowing UPDATEs to resolved/resolved_at/resolved_by
--      This creates confusion about "append-only" guarantees.
--      SOLUTION: violations becomes 100% append-only, decisions are tracked separately.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS violation_decisions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    violation_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES violations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    
    -- Decision type
    decision_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (decision_type IN (
        'acknowledged',      -- Team aware, no action needed
        'false_positive',    -- Not actually a violation
        'resolved',          -- Issue fixed
        'escalated',         -- Sent to management/security
        'dismissed',         -- Admin dismissed with reason
        'wont_fix'           -- Known issue, accepted risk
    )),
    
    -- Who made the decision
    decided_by TEXT NOT NULL,
    
    -- When
    decided_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    
    -- Evidence/reasoning
    notes TEXT,
    evidence JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    
    -- Metadata
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    
    CONSTRAINT violation_decisions_once_per_type UNIQUE (violation_id, decision_type)
);

-- Index for fast lookup by violation
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_violation_decisions_violation_id 
    ON violation_decisions(violation_id);

-- Index for decisions by user
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_violation_decisions_decided_by 
    ON violation_decisions(decided_by);

-- Index for decisions by date
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_violation_decisions_decided_at 
    ON violation_decisions(decided_at DESC);

-- ============================================================================
-- PART 2: MAKE VIOLATIONS TRUE APPEND-ONLY
-- ============================================================================
-- Remove UPDATE capability from resolved/resolved_at/resolved_by
-- These columns are now DEPRECATED - use violation_decisions instead

-- First, migrate existing resolved violations to violation_decisions
INSERT INTO violation_decisions (violation_id, decision_type, decided_by, decided_at, notes)
